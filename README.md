# Evaluating-Hawkishness-and-Dovishness-of-FOMC-Meeting-Minute

In this project, we explore the sentiment of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) communications over the past 13 years, focusing on Meeting Minutes, Fed speeches, and Press Conference transcripts. 

By utilizing FinBERT, a sentiment analysis model fine-tuned for financial texts, we assess the tone of these statements, categorizing them into "Hawkishness" and "Dovishness" based on the text in each document.
